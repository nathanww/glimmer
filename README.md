# Glimmer--Brainwave entrainment and neurofeedback for Windows

Glimmer is a program for visual brainwave entrainment. Unlike many other programs, it's informed by current brainwave research and designed to be used *while you're doing other things on your computer*, so those things can benefit from the effects of stimulation. Glimmer can also be used for neurofeedback and "closed-loop" stimulation witht the Neurosky MindWave Mobile device.

## Getting Started

You can start Glimmer by running glimmer.exe from the "application.windows32" folder. The full-screen configuration menu should open immediatley. Select the options you want to use and click start.

### Code

Glimmer is written using Processing 2.2.1 and depends on the Mindset Processing library for interfacing with Neurosky devices.
